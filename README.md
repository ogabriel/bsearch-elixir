# Bsearch

Implementation of a binary search using tuples.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `bsearch` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bsearch, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## TODO

- member?/find_index
  - use module.compare to compare certain data types
  - find by function - like use a function to enter a map or something
- valid? - check if the tuple is valid to be used by the binary search
